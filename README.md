# Project : Smart Fire Alarm System

**Description**:

The Smart Fire Alarm System is designed to detect and alert early fire hazards in apartments, helping to minimize loss of life and property. The system uses advanced sensors to collect data about the environment, then processes the data and issues alerts when it detects signs of fire.

**System block diagram:**



**Sensors block:**
+ Includes fire detection sensors such as gas sensors, heat sensors, infrared sensors, flame sensors...
Collect data about fire hazards from the environment and send it to the central processor.

**Software:**
+ Real Time Processing Block: Analyzes data from sensors and sends alerts when signs of fire are detected.
+ Alert Block: Immediately notifies users through various methods such as websocket, HTTPS, Amazon SNS, Gmail, SMS or calls.
***Programming Language: ***
   + Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework
   + Frontend (mobile app): React Native
